# Microtarget: Why the pollsters failed to predict Trump's victory  

Donald Trump’s team used an advertising technology called _“data onboarding”_ to microtarget swing voters in the 2016 election. As explained in [The Coupon Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4ykpXxOsnE&t=5m25s&index=8&list=PL9CKkRY_Ibtp-UfGaQ5sfGOoYSa3-d1gP), this esoteric service allows a marketer to show targeted ads online using consumers’ name and address data. In 2002, Congress responded to George W. Bush’s contentious election by passing the Help America Vote Act ([HAVA](http://www.pewresearch.org/2018/02/15/commercial-voter-files-and-the-study-of-u-s-politics/)), which made public voters’ [names and addresses](https://qz.com/1011429/137-things-the-republican-party-wants-to-know-about-every-american-voter/), for instance in [Florida](https://flvoters.com/). HAVA put the election system on a collision course with advertising technology. That came to a head when a data-onboarding company [partnered](http://www.l2political.com/blog/2015/11/08/l2s-national-voter-file-available-through-liveramp/) with a company selling a national voter file. This meant that a political marketer could target [185 million](http://www.l2political.com/products/data/) registered voters with unprecedented precision, showing ads to just one thousand people at a time. That partnership was the linchpin for Trump’s marketing strategy. Moreover, it allowed Trump to leverage **early voting results** to identify his most effective messages and to deploy them at swing voters just before Election Day. Both the [Clinton](https://books.google.com/books?id=UjAIDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=what+happened+comey&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj4kMjOj8LZAhVkw4MKHc5nCBAQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=microtargeting&f=false) and Trump campaigns microtargeted voters, but only Trump prioritized data onboarding, which gave him an overlooked advantage.

# Early voting results
## This repo demonstrates the accessibility and importance of early voting results. 
In digital marketing, A marketer shows ads to consumers to provoke an action and one of the biggest challenges is attribution.  Attribution is when that marketer tries to figure out: of the consumers that acted (e.g., bought my product or voted for my candidate), which ads did they see? Early voting results were crucial to Trump's victory because they let him measure the effectiveness of his digital ads. Early voting results solved Trump's attribution problem.  This isn't theoretical: Molly Schweickert from Cambridge Analytica, the company Trump hired, [explained how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB2BJjMNXpA&feature=youtu.be&t=33m40s) they used early voting results for attribution.

This repo containts early voting results from [Georgia's 6th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia%27s_6th_congressional_district_special_election,_2017) congressional district special election to demonstrate the how this data critical data is freely available. The election took place on June 20th, 2017 and I [downloaded these files](http://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/voterabsenteefile.do) on June 9th. The important fields to note are: `Application Date`,	`Ballot Issued Date`,	`Ballot Return Date`, and	`Ballot Style`. This dataset includes the date when the early voting happened, but does not say which candidate a voter selected (that happened through surveys). A political marketer could have used this data to identify which types of persuadable people found which messages compelling. The marketer could then send microtargeted ads to similar swing voters just before election day.
